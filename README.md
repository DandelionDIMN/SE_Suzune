# Suzu
## What's this?
It's a simple **scripting processor**,a weak type language.
The name of this project is from "鈴(すず)" in Japanese.
It's design for word processing and simple graphic support,based on C++ STL and STL2.
(feel so sorry for my broken English)

## How to use these codes
Complie them in Visual Studio 2010 or later verison.
Please add SDL2 includes and librarires into yourproject parameters.If you want to process script and don't want to modify inside codes,just using Utilclass,all necessary goods are here(for example,Util::ScriptStart()).

## How to run 
download SDL2 library and extract SDL2.dll to the path of suzu binary.(Err...I didn't write the code for
extend function now so you need this only.)

## Support
Just post issues anytime in Chinese or English.
