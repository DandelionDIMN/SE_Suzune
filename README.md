# Kagami Project

Just another wild flower.

## What's this?
It's a project of experimental script language. The name of this project is from Japanese kanji "鏡"(かがみ).

## Design
I want to create a simple language for simple visual novel developing. Kagami is design for logic 
implementation, not CPU intensive job. This project contains a try-catch free implementation with C++17.

## About repo branch
"master" is complete version of code in "testing" branch. IT'S NOT REAL STABLE BRANCH! "testing" is current 
developing branch.

"x.x-stable" is real stable version of interpreter. 

## How to use these codes?

### Windows Platform
Compile them in Visual Studio 2017 or later version.(MSVC 14+)

### Linux/BSD Platform
You need a compiler that supports C++17 standard.
