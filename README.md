# Suzu
## What's this?
It's a simple **scripting processor** that can run script file written in "Suzu",a weak type language.
I develop it because of my interest.I can work on it in my spare time only.
It cannot work now and there's no time for me to write any documents about design.
(feel so sorry for my broken English)

## How to use
Complie them in Visual Studio 2010 or later verison.Please add SDL2 includes and librarires into your
project parameters.If you want to process script and don't want to modify inside codes,just using Util
class,all necessary goods are here.
