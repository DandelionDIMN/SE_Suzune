# Suzu
## What's this?
it's a simple **scripting parser** that can run script file written in "Suzu".
"Suzu" is a weak type language.
I develop it because of my interest.I can work on it in my spare time only.
It cannot work now and there's no time for me to write any documents about design.
(feel so sorry for my broken English)

## How to use
you can simply download these codes and compile it by GCC/CLANG.
please enable C++11 in compiling parameters.
