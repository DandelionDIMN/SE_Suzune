(feel so sorry for my broken English)

## How to use these codes
Complie them in Visual Studio 2010 or later verison.If you want to process script and don't want to modify inside codes,just using Util class,all necessary goods are here(for example,Util::ScriptStart()).

## How to run 
Copy necessary plugin and script file to the path of scripter binary,and execute "binaryname.exe scriptfile"
Enter terminal mode by starting directly.You cannot using cycle code in this mode now(I will fix it).
