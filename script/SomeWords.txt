Once we held hands at the ticket wicket
The same old noise, the brand new wind
Even though I was supposed to cheerfully see you off
I was just watching your back as I wasn't able to smile
 
I hoped the season when you became an adult
Would not be awash in sad songs
I wanted to tell you something in the end
Fumbling for the words to replace a goodbye
 
I had thought that guiding you by the hand
Was my duty that must be done
But I now understand
Those past days will guide us to the way
 
While you become an adult
I begin to change as well
If only there is a song like this
We can belong together here no matter when
